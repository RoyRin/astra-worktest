        "### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This task is designed to assess your research skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills in a time-constrained environment. It comes in two parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "- PART 1 (Research Iterating) You’ll perform a short investigation into using In-Context learning as a potential solution to Weak to Strong Generalisation.\n",
        "- PART 2 (Research Communication) Then, you’ll submit a recording of yourself walking through what you tried, what you found, and what you would want to work on next (not necessarily in that order).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Task Description:\n",
        "\n",
        "- On the TruthfulQA dataset (which the starter code below loads for you), choose a sweep of models on the OpenRouter API that perform at different levels on the task. We recommend starting with Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1 70B and Llama 3.1 405B.\n",
        "- Prompt the largest model with few-shot examples using answers generated by one of the weaker models in the sweep.\n",
        "    - **You should determine a Performance Gap Recovered (PGR) metric** by comparing the performance of the weaker model when prompted with \"gold\" few-shot examples, the performance of the strong model when prompted with \"weak-labelled\" few-shot examples, and the performance of the strong model when prompted with \"gold\" few-shot examples.\n",
        "- If you have time for additional followup, you could consider exploring any of the following ideas, or others that you’re more interested in!\n",
        "    - how PGR varies with different gaps between strong and weak models\n",
        "    - how the PGR changes with the number of examples in the few-shot prompt.\n",
        "    - how to tweak the few-shot prompt to improve the PGR (e.g. giving the strong model some indication of the strength of the labels)\n",
        "    - how the PGR changes if you use chain of thought\n",
        "    - Trying more tasks or models (https://openrouter.ai/models; remember you have a budget so be aware of model costs)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Deliverables\n",
        "Please upload the following to this form:\n",
        "1. Your Colab notebook, containing the exact code at the end of the 5 hour testing period.\n",
        "  * Reminder: you can develop your code in a different IDE but you must paste your final code back into this notebook since you will be graded for what's in this notebook.\n",
        "2. A 30-minute verbal explanation of your work. This explanation should be a **recording of yourself & your screen as you explain what you tried, and what you’d want to try next.**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    * Choose one of the following formats to present your work:\n",
        "    \n",
        "      1. A set of slides summarizing your approach, results, and next steps (**preferred**).\n",
        "      2. A well-organized and documented Colab notebook that you can walk through and discuss, explaining your approach, experiments, and results. (e.g. document and structure your notebook for a presentation)\n",
        "      \n",
        "    Think of this as your slot in a weekly project meeting - what would you ask for clarity on? How would you provide additional context for your supervisors, collaborators, and mentor?\n",
        "3. (if used) Presentations slides.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Allocation\n",
        "\n",
        "Spend no more than **five hours** on this task (including time for communicating your results). We understand this is a limited timeframe, and we're as interested in your ability to communicate your approach and thought process as well as the quality and volume of work produced.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will measure the time between when you recieved the email with this assessment and when you submit it via the provided form.\n",
        "\n",
        "(In addition to the 5-hour time limit, there is an additional 30minute grace period for you to upload your videos. We will check the edit history of your notebook to verify the last time you edited your code.)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Compute Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "- You have \\$300 allocated per key for $600 in total.\n",
        "- Please spend no more than 50 threads at any one time, to be mindful of other applicants completing the takehome at the same time as you.\n",
        "- If you get error `openai.PermissionDeniedError: Error code: 403 - {'error': {'message': 'Key limit exceeded. Manage it using https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys', 'code': 403}}` then you have used your initial 300. Please switch to the backup key and watch your usage carefully. If you use up the \\$300 on this second key, you won't be able to continue experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
        "\n",
        "We will assess your submission roughly equally across the following axes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Problem understanding and setup\n",
        "2. Clarity of thinking and approach\n",
        "3. Implementation and experimentation\n",
        "4. Analysis and interpretation of results\n",
        "5. Communication of your process and findings\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, we're not looking for a complete solution in this timeframe. We're interested in seeing how you approach and think about complex problems."
